            /*
             * Steps:
             * STEP-1: Copy the code and paste it in a file "Hello.java" with
                       ".java" extension.
             * STEP-2: Open the command prompt / power shell / terminal and go to the
                       file location.
             * STEP-3: Compile the code by running the command "javac Hello.java".
                       If you have Java 11 or higher, you do not need to compile.
             * STEP-4: Run the code by running the command "java Hello". 
                       If you have Java 11 or higher, run "java Hello.java" without
                       doing STEP-3.
             * STEP-5: See the output.
