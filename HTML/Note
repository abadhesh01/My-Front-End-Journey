-> HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language".
   
   "Hyper Text" :: (1) The way in which the web pages (HTML documents) are linked together.
                   (2) The link provided in the web pages. 
   
   "Markup Language" :: Language used to define the web page (HTML document) with various 
                        tags that tells the web browser how to structure it to display.

-> Founder: Berners-Lee

-> Release: 
   1. Year 1991:: Initial Release
   2. Year 1995:: HTML 2.0 (Standard Release)
   3. Year 1999:: HTML 4.01 (Major Release)
   4. Year 2012:: HTML 5 (Latest Release)

-> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase tags from HTML 4 and onwards.

-> To know all the HTML tags and their attributes, refer: 
   https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_tags_reference.htm   

-> Overview / Structure:
   <!DOCTYPE ...> :: Defines the document type and html version.
   <html> :: Encloses the entire HTML document.
             It contains a <head> and a <body> tag.
   <head> :: Represents the HTML document header.
             It contains tags like <meta>, <title> and <link> etc. 
   <title> :: Represents the HTML document title.
   <body> :: Represents the body of the HTML document.
             It contains tags like <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <div> and <p> etc. 
   
   For demo refer to "hello.html" file.
   
-> Basic Tags:
   <h1> to <h6> :: HEADING TAGS: Six levels of HEADING having different sizes.
                                 "h1" is the largest heading and "h6" is the smallest heading.
   <p> :: PARAGRAPH TAG: Represents a paragraph.
   <br /> :: LINE BREAK TAG: Breaks the line and starts the text or anything following it from the next line.
   <hr /> :: HORIZONTAL LINE TAG: Draws a horizontal line.
   <center> :: CENTER TAG: Puts the content inside it to the center of the HTML document or table cell.
   <pre> :: PRESERVER FORMAT TAG: Preserves the text inside it and displays the text in the exact format it is
                                  written by the user/developer.
   &nbsp; :: NON-BREAKING SPACE: Applies non breaking spaces between the texts if applied instead of normal spaces
                                 between the texts. It prevents the splitting/breaking of the text across two lines.    

   For demo refer to "index.html" and "index02.html".                              

-> Elements: 
   HTML Elements basically have 3 parts. 
   They are - 1. Starting Tag
              2. Content     
              3. Ending Tag [Always preceded with a forward slash("/").]
   Example: "<p>A simple paragraph.</p>"
            Here "<p>" is the starting tag; "</p>" is the ending tag and 
            the text, "A simple paragraph." is the content of the paragraph element.                                        
                                 
-> Empty Elements: 
   (1) The <br />, <hr /> and <img /> etc. tags are the examples of EMPTY ELEMENTS  
       or VOID ELEMENTS i.e. these do not have any enclosing tag as they contain nothing.
   (2) Empty elements must have space between the the characters("br" or "hr" or "img") and 
       forward slash("/") otherwise, older browsers will be troubled rendering them.
   (3) Missing the forward slash("/") will make the empty elements invalid for XHTML.                                
   (4) For more details, visit:    
       https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-empty-elements-in-html/

-> Nested Element:
   Element(s) inside another element is called as NESTED ELEMENT(S).        

-> Attributes:
   The attribute defines the characteristics of an HTML element.
   The attributes have two parts. They are - 1. Name
                                             2. Value
   Example: align = "center"
            Here "align" is the name of the attribute and "center" is the value of
            the attribute". The "align" attribute aligns the text/content to the specified position.
            
   World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase attribute names and values from HTML 4 and onwards.
   For more about World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), visit: https://www.w3.org/         
            
   For demo refer to "index03.html".

-> Core Attributes:
   There are 4 core attributes used in majority of the HTML elements. 
   
   They are -
   1. id :: It is used to uniquely identify any element inside the HTML document.
   2. title :: Defines the pop-up title of the element.
               When cursor is hovered over the element with title having a value, the 
               value of the title is displayed and moving the cursor away from the element 
               will hide the value of the title.     
   3. class :: Used to specify one or multiple CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) classes with space(s)   
               for styling of elements.
   4. style :: Allows to specify CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) rules within an element.

   For demo refer to "index04.html".

-> Internationalization Attributes:
   There are 3 internationalization attribute available for most of the XHTML elements.
   
   They are -
   1. dir :: Defines the direction in which the text should flow.
             For demo refer to "index05.html". 
   2. lang :: Indicates the main language used inside the document.
   3. xml:lang :: XHTML replacement of the "lang" attribute.
